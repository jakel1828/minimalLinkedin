# Minimal LinkedIn

Minimal LinkedIn is an extension for Chromium-based browsers intended to reduce distractions on LinkedIn via simple CSS and JavaScript.

The plugin reduces distractions on LinkedIn by:
- Hiding the sidebars on either side of the LinkedIn feed.
- Hiding the notification bell near the user's profile picture in the top nav menu
- Changing the title in the title bar so that users don't see new notifications.

## Requirements
Minimal LinkedIn requires a Chromium-based browser with Developer Mode enabled.

2. Access Manage Extensions in your browser. (In Brave browser, naviagation to Settings --> Extensions --> Manage Extensions.)
3. Enable Developer Mode if not already enabled.
4. Click "Load Unpacked" button and browse to and select the folder containing the JSON, CSS, and JavaScript files from the repo.

## Notes
Below are some notes about the features of Minimal LinkedIn.

1. Hiding the sidebars can make difficult navigating to options such as Followed Hashtags, Newsletters, and Groups. Disabling the extension will make these options easily accessible again.
2. In addition to hiding the Notifications bell, the extension also hides the Messaging option in the navigation menu. But Messaging can still be accessed via the chat box in the bottom right of the page.
3. The custom title refreshes every 500 milliseconds.

## Roadmap
Below is a list of the planned changes for the extension.

1. Eliminating the red dot on the favicon notifiying users of new activity.
